            {`  I am an enthusiast of extreme sports and what I love about these
          sports is the creative aspect and the fact that each athlete has their
          own identity and style. Over two years ago, my passion for technology
          caught up with me. Since then, I have been training in web
          development, and my current goal is to create websites that reflect
          the values of the sports i pratice: creativity, originality, and
          technical skill.`}
